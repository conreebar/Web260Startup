# Workout Tracker Site

My website will help users track their workouts and diets so that they can see their progress, stay accountable to themselves and others, and do so easily from their phone.  They also will have access to stock workout plans that they can modify, as well as instructions on various workouts and recommended diets.  Upon signing in, a user can see their weekly/daily calendar and know exactly what they've planned for that day.  They will see what other people they've friended have accomplished that week as well.  This will be ideal for runners or gym goers to maintain schedules and diets for their physical health.

# Key Features

- Sign-in/account creation: to better assist individuals using the site, each account will store their personal plans and calendars, among other things
- Workout Calendar: plan several weeks ahead and list specifics of how you'll workout.  After a workout, update the day with what actuals occured during the workout.  Adjust plans based on pacing you see in your workouts.
- Diet Calendar: similar to the workout calendar, and optional for those who do not wish to use, is a calendar for tracking food.  For people who struggle to eat too much or too little, this will let people track their calories, protein, number of meals, time of day that meals are eaten, etc.
- Workout suggestions: someone who wants to try a new kind of exercise can view instructions on new kinds of workouts.
- Community: people can see their friends' Personal Bests when they make new ones.  They can brag to their small circle to get support and praise for their accomplishments.

# Technologies
- HTML: at least five html pages, 1 for a very mini social page to see friends' accomplishments and like them, 2 to hold the calendars, 1 for logging in, and at least one, maybe more, for an information database displaying example workouts, diets, and instructions. 
- CSS: Styling for the basic backgrounds of the website, accounting for the large space that calendars will take up on a screen
- Javascript: A lot of the social page and the login/register page will use Jscript.  Also, on the calendar, when a PR is met an option to add that to the social page
- React: use this to display the social tab, loading the 'post' objects into the social tab view
- Web Service: I will use preexisting calendar API's and modify them for my purposes
- Authentification: Each user will have to sign in before using the website
- Database Data: The database will store the calendar data, social tab posts, and user information such as a friends list
- Websocket Data: The calendars and the social tab will be generated by websocket data.

# Midterm Notes

HTML and CSS Basics
Link Element:

The <link> element is used to link external resources like CSS files to the HTML document.
Div Tag:

The <div> tag is a block-level element used to group content and apply styles or layouts.
#Title vs .Grid Selector:

The #title selector targets an element with the specific id="title".
The .grid selector targets all elements with the class grid.
Padding vs Margin:

Padding: Space between the content and the element's border.
Margin: Space outside the element's border, between the element and others.
Flexbox Image Display:

Flexbox layout properties determine how images are aligned, wrapped, or spaced within a container.
Padding CSS:

Controls the spacing inside an element between its content and its border. Padding values can apply to different sides (top, right, bottom, left).
CSS Box Model:

Ordering of box layers: Content → Padding → Border → Margin.
Changing Background Color of Divs:

Use the CSS rule: div { background-color: red; }
Display an Image with Hyperlink in HTML:

<a href="url"><img src="image.jpg" alt="Image"></a>
Set Specific Text Color:

CSS Example: span#trouble { color: green; }
JavaScript Fundamentals
Arrow Function Syntax:

Provides a concise way to declare functions using () => {}.
Using Map with an Array:

map creates a new array by transforming each element of the original array according to a function.
getElementByID and addEventListener:

getElementById() selects an element by its ID, and addEventListener() adds an event listener to handle actions like clicks or inputs.
JavaScript Object Syntax:

Example: let obj = { key: value };
Changing Text Color with ID Selector:

Use JavaScript: document.getElementById("byu").style.color = "green";
JavaScript Promises Output:

Promises represent asynchronous operations. Output depends on whether the promise resolves or rejects.
DOM, JSON, and JavaScript Objects
True Statements about the DOM:

The DOM represents the structure of the web page as an object model that can be manipulated with JavaScript.
Span Element's Default CSS Display:

inline is the default CSS display property of a <span>.
Declaring the Document Type:

At the beginning of an HTML document: <!DOCTYPE html>
Valid Syntax for Control Structures:

if, else, for, while, switch all follow specific syntax rules. Example:
javascript
Copy code
if (condition) {
  // code
} else {
  // code
}
Adding Properties to JavaScript Objects:

Yes, you can dynamically add properties to an object:
javascript
Copy code
obj.newProp = value;
Include JavaScript in HTML:

Use the <script> tag.
Describing JSON:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for data interchange, using key-value pairs.
Command Line and Networking
Command Line Basics:

chmod: Changes file permissions.
pwd: Prints current working directory.
cd: Changes directory.
ls: Lists directory contents.
vim, nano: Text editors.
mkdir: Creates directories.
mv, rm: Move or remove files.
man: Opens manual pages.
ssh: Starts a secure shell session.
ps: Lists processes.
wget: Downloads files from the web.
sudo: Executes commands with superuser privileges.
Remote Shell Session:

ssh creates a secure remote shell session.
Using -la with ls:

Lists all files, including hidden ones, in a long format with detailed information.
DNS, Protocols, and Web Security
Domain Structure:

Example: For banana.fruit.bozo.click:
.click is the top-level domain (TLD).
bozo is the root domain.
banana.fruit are subdomains.
HTTPS and Web Certificates:

A web certificate is necessary for HTTPS to encrypt communication between client and server.
DNS A Record:

Can point to an IP address or another A record, providing resolution for domain names.
Ports:

Port 443: HTTPS
Port 80: HTTP
Port 22: SSH
Review Key Concepts
Ensure students understand how the box model works, the difference between block and inline elements, and how JavaScript can manipulate the DOM.
Review arrow functions, objects, and promises in JavaScript.
Practice navigating the command line and understanding networking fundamentals like DNS and ports.
