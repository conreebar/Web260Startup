NOTES:

day 1 notes:
1. Vscode has very good integration with github use it instead of git bash
2. resolving conflicts has a weird UI on vscode, but will let you know when two places edit the same code

Ideas for startup:
1. workout website
   a.track your workouts, planned and actual
   b.track your diet, planned and actual
   c.share both of the above with the community
   d.share new PR's for running/benching/etc
